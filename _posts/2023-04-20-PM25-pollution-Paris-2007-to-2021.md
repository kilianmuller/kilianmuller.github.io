[Airparif](https://airparif.asso.fr) is an independent non-profit organisation monitoring the air quality in Île de France, the region of France containing Paris. On their website they have [maps showing the average air pollution](https://airparif.asso.fr/surveiller-la-pollution/bilan-et-cartes-annuels-de-pollution) for different pollutants, starting in 2007. From these I created the following animation, which shows the evolution of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less:
