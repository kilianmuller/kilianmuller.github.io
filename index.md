I am an experimental physicist based in Paris, France. I obtained my PhD in the atom-optics group of [Alain Aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Aspect) at the [Laboratoire Charles Fabry](https://www.lcf.institutoptique.fr). Under the supervision of Vincent Josse I worked in the [Quantum Transport in Disorder](https://www.lcf.institutoptique.fr/groupes-de-recherche/gaz-quantiques/experiences/quantum-transport-disorder) team where we investigated weak and strong localization phenomena.

I followed Alexei Ourjoumtsev to the Coll√®ge de France as a PostDoc to help start the [Quantum Photonics](https://jeipcdf.cnrs.fr/quantum-photonics/) group. The focus of my work was the lensless control and imaging of cold atoms through a multimode fiber.

I made the jump from academia to industry to work at the startup [LightOn](https://lighton.ai). In its hardware research division I built optical processors - specialized machines that perform random projections for randomized numerical linear algebra and machine learning applications. During this time I have become interested in the application of tools and techniques developed by the machine learning community to problems in optics.

Most recently I have joined [Welinq](https://www.welinq.fr) to build quantum memories.

You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01127067).  
A full list of the publications and patents I (co-)authored is on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OP_vsl4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I like taking [photos](https://kilianmuller.myportfolio.com) and [3D printing](https://www.printables.com/social/220917-kilian/).
